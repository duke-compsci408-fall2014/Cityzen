Future implementation:
	Support multiple cities - requires support in the database as well as login in the mobile app
	Support geolocation-based polls - requires a table in the database which lists polls by location and logic in the mobile app to alert users of nearby polls
	In-app voting - allow users to vote on issues within the application, without opening a browser
	Support in all platforms - currently only supported by iOS and Android
